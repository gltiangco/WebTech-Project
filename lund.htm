Getting Around
    <p>Going around the South of Sweden is extremely easy and affordable with public transportation, specifically the bus. 
    Download the app, Skånetrafiken to book buses and trains that can take you as far as Copenhagen in 30 minutes. 
    Everything here is digital, so you will rarely be able to physically buy tickets on the bus or trains 
    without this mobile app. </p>

    <p>In Lund, the chance you will be able to call and Uber are slim to none. If you prefer to ride in your own car, you can 
    download their version of Uber, Skåne Taxi. </p>

    <p>Another great alternative is walking! Lund is quite a small town, with most places just a 10-15 minute walk way.
   You may also rent a bike or electric scooter from one of the bike sharing stations or scooters scattered around the city.</p>

<div class="payment">
Payment 
<p>
Sweden is a cashless society with most vendors and establishments taking credit card. However, it is super important to note
that for individuals who use a credit card without a PIN code, you will need your passport with you. Most European credit cards
now have a PIN, so when a signature is needed, certain vendors are very strict about the form of ID needed to verify your identity.
In ICA, one of the main grocery stores, I was shied away several times because I did not have carry an international drivers license
or passport to verify my signature.

<div class="sus">
Sustainability 
<p>
Swedes are very conscious about envrionmental sustainability which comes quite natural to them and is quite matter of fact. 
The waste disposal system in households and in establishments are segrated to 7 different bins: metal, glass, paper, compost, 
general waste, hard plastic and soft plastic. They are also pioneers in alternative food products, birthing one of the first 
and biggest Oat milk brands, Oatly. Red meat is also intentionally higher than usual to detract Swedes from regularly consuming 
red meat. 
</p>
<p>
A significant population of Swedes are either vegetarian or vegan because there are mutliple alternatives available at groceries, 
as well as majority of restaurants offering a vegetarian and vegan option.

Activities 
<p>
<li>Kulturen - a museum experience like no other! There's something for everyone here ranging from 
modern art exhibits, to a historical timeline of Lund, to a whole outdoor museum of original historic
houses. 
</li>
<li>Botanical Gardens - have traditional  sprawling flowers and trees </li>
<li>Attend Events - I got to attend some of the coolest events during my stay here such as 
a lecture from the lead graphic designer of the UN Sustainable Development Goals on the intersection of 
marketing and sustainability. Lund is a very presitgious university with many unique events always 
happening on campus. 
</li>
<li>Fika - a Swedish tradition, simply described as coffee and pastries. Check my list below
for some great coffee shops serving classic Swedish cinammon buns. 
</li>
<li>See Sweden - Lund is convenientally located just a short distance away 
from so many cities! Check out my guide on <a href="malmo.htm"> Malmo</a> or head 20 more minutes
North on the train to Copenhagen. You can also head to neighboring towns like Lomma to check out
the beach, or take a 2.5 hour bus to Gothenburg, Sweden's 2nd largest city.  </li>
</p>
</div>
<div class="restos">
Restaurants 
<p>
<li>Tugg - rustic indoor and outdoor vibes serving one of the best burgers I've had.</li>
<li>Creperiet - french creprie with great lunch time specials at very decent prices and large servings.</li>
<li>Fenngson Dumpling house - more of a grab and go meal for a cheap set of rice and dumplings.</li>
<li>Ishiri - one of my favorite restaurants with weekly varying menus centered around traditional thai cuisine 
with some slight swedish touches.  </li>
<li>Lundafalafel - cash based kiosk for a tasty and cheap snack or meal on the go</li>
<li>Cafe Italia - go-to place to get work done, or catch up with friends over foccacia sandwiches and a latte. </li>
<li>Mat & Destillat - a great dinner location for a special occasion </li>

<div class="accomodations">
Accomodations 
<li>Students - looking for a place to stay for the semester? FB groups are probably your best 
bet at finding lodging if you were unable to get lodging through the school. There are other agencies and 
websites but some listings are a little unreliable.
</li> 
<li> Visitors - you can't go wrong with Air BnB but the Grand Hotel Lund centrally located is a great option. The More Hotel
Lund is a little deeper in the city, but is also a great alternative if you're looking 
for a more quiet and quiant boutique hotel.
