Getting Around
<p>
Despite being the 3rd largest city in Sweden, Malmo is an extremely walkable city. It's actually easier to walk around here 
than Lund because most of the commercial establishments are within a 10-20 minute radius. The buses are also extremely 
accessible.
</p>
Activities 
<p>
<li>Moderna Museet Malmo - Malmo's modern museum houses some of the best exhibits ranging from Warhol to Banksy and its all free! 
</li>
<li>Thrifting - the selection at the vintage and thrift stores in Sweden is of exceptional quality at super decent prices. Check
out Humana Secondhand, Beyond Retro, and Emmaus.</li>
<li>Fika - You can't get enough of Fika in Sweden! My number 1 place was AB Smalands, located right in the center of Malmo. Aside from having 
fantastic coffee, Cinammon Rolls, Applie Tarts and Ham & Cheese Croissants, AB Smalands is also a beautiful life-style concept store. 
The clothing brands, plant section, furniture, and all things home are a site in itself. 
</li>
<li> Kungsparken - take a walk in a beautiful, water surrounded park and enjoy nature at its finest. </li>
</p>
Restaurants - please note that you'll need to reserve for nearly all of the restaurants on this list!
<p>
<li>Namu - a delicious intersection of Korean and Swedish food. </li>
<li>Johan P - some of the freshest seafood dishes you'll find, with amazing desserts to finish off. </li>
<li>Bastard - a dining experience that will leave you more than satisfied with the gourmet dishes being served. </li>
<li>MJ's - one of the hippest and chicest hotels I've ever seen, with an ornate skylight covered in vines right in the middle
of the dining area. Have cocktails in the lobby where you'll find a live DJ spinning or enjoy scrumptious brunch or dinner. 
</li>
<li>Malmo Saluhall - from Ramen, to Neapolitan pizzas, to poke, to fresh seafood, you can satisfy most cravings at this old train station
converted into an urban foodhall. 
</li>
<li>Max's - one of the only Swedish fast food serving premium meals. The burger with halloumi was my personal favorite! </li>
<li>Vollmore - a 6-7 course meal worth every bite. The plates were prepared with such detail that I have yet to see
with a degustation dinner. From the appetizers, to the mains, to the dessert and cheese, everything was literal perfection.
</li>
    </p>
Lodging 
<p>
<li>Hotel Duxiana - a very Swedish minamilist boutique hotel setup apartment style with modern and spacious rooms, just
facing the little river and a 3 minute walk to the main square. </li>
<li>MJ's - mentioned earlier as one of the hippest hotels around, MJ's comes with some noise with the continous flow of people entering
the hotel lobby. The rooms come with detailed decoration and cool coffee table books, but lie on the older side. </li>
<li>Elite - one of the bigger chains in the region, Elite is right in front of the train station and like MJ and Duxiana, have access to the main 
square in just a few minutes.     </li>
